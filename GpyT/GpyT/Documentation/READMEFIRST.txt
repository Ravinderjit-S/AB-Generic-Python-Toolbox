Prerequisites:
- Matlab + Signal Processing Toolbox, release 2015a
- tested on Windows systems only

Setup instructions:
- Extract the GMT archive into a local folder.
- Create a (Windows) system environment variable named "GMTROOT" and set it's Value to be absolute path of the above folder.
  Note that this only requrired for the csViewer functionality  (cf. manual) and may be skipped without loss 
  of essential functionality of the toolbox.
- Modify your Matlab path to include the toolbox folder and its subfolders (and remove any previous GMT-related folders from your path).
- In Matlab, navigate to the Demo subfolder and execute the scripts in turn. They should run without error if the toolbox is setup correctly.
